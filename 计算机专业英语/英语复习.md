U2
The requirements document has to be such that the client and users can understand it easily and the developers can use it as a basis for software development.
需求文档必须能够让客户和用户容易理解，并且能够让开发人员将其作为软件开发的基础来使用
Though use cases are meant for specification, as they are natural and story-like, by expressing them at different levels of abstraction they can also be used for problem analysis
尽管用例是为规格说明而设定的，但由于其自然性和故事性，通过在不同的抽象级上表达用例，用例也可以用于问题分析

U3
The detailed schedule is one in which the tasks are broken into smaller, schedulable tasks, and then assigned to specific team members, while preserving to overall schedule and effort estimates.
